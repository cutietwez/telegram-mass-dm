Start off by going to https://my.telegram.org and logging in with the account you're going to use to mass dm with.

Once finished create an application, put any name, can be "sadiajdsajnd"

Put the API ID and API HASH into the main.py script.
Also put the phone number in there

Run python main.py (in command)

Paste in the phone number if it asks for it, if it doesn't and just asks for the code straight up, paste in the code and the 2FA later if it asks for it.

Once finished insert your usernames and message in username.txt & message.txt

You can now start mass dming by running the script. Sometimes after reaching 25-50 DMs you cannot message more people due to a ratelimit. If you get this contact https://t.me/spambot and write /start to it twice. It should remove the ratelimit. If it's still ratelimited wait 6h for it to get removed.
